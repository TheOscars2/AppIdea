## MVP
- [ ] I want to track the food in my refrigerator.  When I buy food, I enter it into the app and it remembers when I bought it.
- [ ] I am cooking and want to mark that I have eaten food.  I can mark food as gone (1/2 gone, etc).
- [ ] I have food that has gone bad.  I want the app to know when it expired based on when I bought it and how long it should last.
- [ ] I have recipes that I enjoy.  I want them in one place, so I can see them when cooking.
  - [ ] Manually add recipes, save link to a recipe.

## Stretch Goals
Note: Lots of ideas, we'll pick a in a direction as we build out the MVP.
- [ ] I know what food I have and what recipes I like, I should see what I can make and what I need to make a given recipe.

- [ ] I should be able to see a list of the food I should buy.
- [ ] If I am in a store, the app should prompt me to use its grocery list.
- [ ] I should be able to track what I'm eating.
- [ ] Given I am tracking what I'm eating, I should be able to get stats about it.
